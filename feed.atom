This is not a breaking change, but to receive performance benefit, you need to make sure @osmoscraft/osmosfeed is listed as dependencies instead of devDependencies in the package.json of your rss reader site.
Changed: Build target from node12 to node14.
Changed: Switched to a more robust rss parser: rss-parser
Fixed: RSS 1.0 feed &lt;dc:date&gt; was not parsed as publish date.
